Data Sets: This assignment will focus on applications of unsupervised learning to image processing. The
first problem focuses on clustering 8x8 pixel images of hand written digits. The second problem focuses
on image denoising. For denoising, we will work with data derived from a single image, a 1200x900 pixel
version of van Goghâ€™s Starry Night. Examples of both data sources are shown below.
